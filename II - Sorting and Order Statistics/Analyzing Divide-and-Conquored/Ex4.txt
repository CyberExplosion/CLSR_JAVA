we have 
with n = 1 --> T(n) = O(n)
with n > 1 --> T(n) = T(n - 1) +   O(n)
                        ^             ^
                        |             |
                    Reduce step     Combine step 
This because it takes O(n) as the worst case to insert a value back into the sorted array A[1..n - 1]
So worst case is O(n^2)
