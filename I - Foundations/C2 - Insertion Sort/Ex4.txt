Combining Integers in Binary form
A = {101}       <-- Examples
B = {111}       <-- Examples
Create a C[n + 1] that stores the result of A + B

Algorithm:

C = new Array(A.length + 1)
int carry = 0;
for i = 0 TO A.length
    C[i] = (A[i] + B[i] + carry) % 2    //Binary result can only be 1 or 0
    carry = (A[i] + B[i] + carry) / 2   //Carry can be 1 or 0. And the sum could be 1, 0 or 3
C[A.length] = carry     //Last- left most number. Could be 0 or 1
