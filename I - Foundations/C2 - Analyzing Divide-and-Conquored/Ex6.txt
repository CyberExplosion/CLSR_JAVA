The loop 5 - 7 while loop does 2 thing
    1) Look for the correct position to insert the value
    2) Shift all biggers value to the right to insert the new value in
Even though we can use Binary Search to reduce the 1st step
into O(lg n). The "shifting" requires on 2nd step still requires
O(n) shift worst case.
Thus, combines with the loop outside, insertion sort still:
    O(n^2)
